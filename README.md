## About Alfa Romeo

Alfa Romeo is an Italian luxury car manufacturer founded on June 24, 1910, in Milan. The company has been known for its racing heritage, distinctive Italian design, and innovative engineering throughout its history.

## Generations

### Early Years (1910-1945)

Founded as "Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili" (A.L.F.A.), the company began producing cars in 1910. During this period, Alfa Romeo established its reputation in motorsport while creating elegant road cars. The company was acquired by Nicola Romeo in 1915, leading to the name change to Alfa Romeo. Notable models from this era include the 24 HP, the legendary 6C series, and the 8C which dominated racing in the 1930s.

### Post-War Renaissance (1946-1986)

After World War II, Alfa Romeo shifted toward mass-market production while maintaining its sporting character. This period saw the introduction of iconic models like the Giulietta, Giulia, and the Spider (made famous by the film "The Graduate"). The company pioneered various technical innovations including double overhead cam engines, transaxles, and advanced suspension designs. Alfa Romeo remained competitive in motorsport, winning the first two Formula One World Championships.

### Fiat Era (1987-2007)

Facing financial difficulties, Alfa Romeo was acquired by the Fiat Group in 1986. This began a period of platform sharing and cost-cutting measures, though the brand maintained its focus on driver engagement and distinctive styling. Notable models from this era include the 164, 156, and 147, which helped reestablish Alfa Romeo's reputation for creating beautiful, sporty cars with character.

### Modern Revival (2008-Present)

Under Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (later Stellantis), Alfa Romeo underwent a significant revival aimed at returning to premium market segments and expanding globally. The brand introduced the 8C Competizione supercar, the 4C sports car, and the Giulia sedan which marked a return to rear-wheel drive. The Stelvio became Alfa Romeo's first SUV, targeting the growing luxury crossover market. Throughout this period, Alfa Romeo has focused on balancing its sporting heritage with modern technology and meeting contemporary market demands.
